Description: A modern and flexible R client for the 'SurveyCTO', a mobile and 
    offline data collection platform, providing a modern and consistent interface for 
    programmatic access to server resources. Built on top of the 'httr2' package, 
    it enables secure and efficient data retrieval and returns analysis-ready 
    data through optional tidying. It includes functions to create, upload, and 
    download server datasets, in addition to fetching form data, files, and 
    submission attachments. Robust authentication and request handling make the 
    package suitable for automated survey monitoring and downstream analysis.
